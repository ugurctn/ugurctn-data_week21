Combined_Starter_Code.ipynb

Starter_Code_BOOOOOOTH-OPTIMIZATION.ipynb

Code Steps

Step 1: Setup and Data Import

Import necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and optimization libraries.

Load datasets required for analysis and optimization tasks.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

Prepare dataframes or arrays to be compatible with subsequent analysis and modeling.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conduct preliminary analysis to understand the distributions, relationships, and characteristics of data.

Generate visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, boxplots) to identify patterns or anomalies.

Step 4: Model Definition and Optimization

Define the objective functions clearly, including variables and constraints.

Choose and implement appropriate optimization algorithms such as linear programming, gradient descent, or genetic algorithms.

Step 5: Optimization Execution

Run optimization models using defined parameters.

Iterate through parameter tuning to achieve optimal solutions.

Step 6: Results and Interpretation

Analyze the output of optimization processes.

Summarize the results clearly, using visualizations and tables for improved understanding.

Step 7: Validation and Sensitivity Analysis

Validate optimization results using alternative methods or scenarios.

Perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate robustness and reliability of the optimized solutions.

Step 8: Conclusions and Recommendations

Provide clear, concise conclusions based on the optimization outcomes.

Suggest recommendations or potential improvements based on analytical findings.
